The aim of this project was to explore retrospective data during the height of COVID from the time of first detected infection to gather an idea of the overall global impact from a mortality perspective. 
Vaccination rates were of brief curiousity, but generally left alone in lieu of exploring other parts of this dataset.

2021 data obtained from https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths was used to explore trends through the following metrics:
1. Total Cases vs Total Deaths
2. Global Deaths by Continent
3. Global Death Percentage 
4. Infection Rates vs Population
